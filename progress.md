## 14-06-2021
- :triangular_flag_on_post: experimentations with the transform matrix
   --> does not allow to properly rotate the image : just a translation and a flip + scaling in this matrix
- ⏲️ RGB overlay debugging
- ✔️ Tests to determine the method to extract seeps and spills length statistics

## TODO

- get the position of the image/patch
- statistics about dimensions of annotations
