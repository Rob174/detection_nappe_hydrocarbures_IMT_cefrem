- ✔️DatasetFactory 

## 08-06-2021
- ✔️ Reduce patch size 
- ✔️ support resolution information backup
- ✔️ Create Dataloader object
- ✔️ Support for Resnet18, VGG16 (EfficientNetv4)
- ✔️ Resolution statistics with patch size of 1000 px and output size of 255
- ✔️ Resolution statistics with patch size of 500 px and output size of 255


## 09-06-2021

- :triangular_flag_on_post: warp affine transformation before making the grid
  - ✔️ add transformation matrix to the cache informations
  - ✔️ apply the transformation
- ✔️ Main script
  - ✔️ resnet trainable
  - ✔️ progressbar training
  - ✔️ validation
  - ✔️ save results

## 10-06-2021

- ✔️ First training
- ✔️ Coloration map
- ✔️ Vizualization system

## 11-06-2021
- :email: Mail inverse_transform matrix
- ✔️ Interactive plot
- ✔️ save model
- ✔️ show result on rgb map
- Confusion matrix

## 14-06-2021
- :triangular_flag_on_post: experimentations with the transform matrix
   --> does not allow to properly rotate the image : just a translation and a flip + scaling in this matrix
- ✔️ RGB overlay debugging
- ✔️ Tests to determine the method to extract seeps and spills length statistics
- ✔️ Extract seeps and spills length statistics

## 15-06-2021
- ✔️ Write RGB overlay
- ✔️ Training Crossentropy
- ✔️ Training MSE
- 🚩🐛 Filter trainings by parameters 
- ✔️ Redo the compressed file annotations to take into account the time codes of the annotations and avoid overlappings
   - ✔️ correct the extract raster to hdf5 file (for reproduction purpose only)
   - ✔️ make a correction script (to remake the annotation file)

## 16-06-2021
- ✔️ Exclude all patches with a margin (select the margin value (uniq, float) and if more than x pixel with this value --> exclude)
- 〰️ Add a legend to the rgb overlay (improve the link between annotations and channels)
- ✔️ Simplify the analysis backend code with pandas

## 18-06-2021
- ✔️ allow interactive buttons
- ✔️ update possibilities
- ✔️ Classify only by telling if there is something or not on the image
- bug fixes
- reflexion about optimization possibilities [#25](https://github.com/Rob174/detection_nappe_hydrocarbures_IMT_cefrem/issues/25)

Working version : [dd43dc4](https://github.com/Rob174/detection_nappe_hydrocarbures_IMT_cefrem/commit/dd43dc4e8fd941a7738dc0a238647b0923182c8b)

- ✔️ Classify only by using 2 probabilities (seep or spill) --> if vector output (0,0) --> other

## 21-06-06
- ✔️dashboard bug fixes
- ✔️ training on 2 classes or 1 class
- ✔️ profiling methods
- balance the dataset

## TODO

Priorities 1️⃣: high priority ; 9️⃣low priority

- 5️⃣ get the position of the image/patch
- 9️⃣ Confusion matrix
- 6️⃣ Rotation augmentation
